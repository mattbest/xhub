# xhub

**xhub** is a backend server for storing and retrieving [uc-xromm](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/uc-xromm)-related study data.  It functions as a web service for the [`xpub`](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/xpub) client.  

The `xpub` client is an alternative command-line interface to the [`xromm.rcc.uchicago.edu`](http://xromm.rcc.uchicago.edu/) data portal.  **xhub** stores/retrieves the JSON-encoded metadata sent/requested by the `xpub`
client.
